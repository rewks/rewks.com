## Introduction

**Note**: This post is not a how-to or a study in the best Checkpoints, settings and prompt syntax. It is a commentary on the subject and the potential implications.

Like many people I have maintained a mild awareness of the development of "AI" over the years and since I am not living under a rock I've noticed the increasing pace of development especially in the last few years. Of course it also helps that the availability of certain models to the public has thrust the industry into the forefront of many netizens minds. ChatGPT in particular has garnered a lot of mainstream media attention, with panicked stories about outperforming humans at certain tasks, spreading misinformation and bringing the integrity of university student's coursework into question. The subject of this blog however is with a slightly different application of machine learning - the generation of artwork based (mostly) on user defined text prompts.

Interspersed throughout the post I will include some of the images that I, or rather the AI, has generated. Admitedly this is partly to show off my creations as I can't help but be a little proud of how well some turn out. Is that weird? I think it is, for I actually had very little to do with them. It took no talent on my part, I just input some text and adjusted a few settings. This does raise an interesting philosophical question - who should the credit for such images be attributed to? Would I be justified in feeling aggrieved should someone take the images, reuse them and claim them as their own? It's a strange new world we're on the edge of.

psst... if you _do_ decide to take my images and reuse them, that is fine but if the context permits it then yeah, crediting me would be appreciated!

## Stable Diffusion

There is a saying _"When it rains, it pours"_ which applies to many things in life, and AI art generators are no different. As soon as they started being made available for public use, more and more started appearing. Often they seem to be an entrepreneurial endeavour, with limited free access and a subscriber model to remove rate-limiting or increase output resolution. Usually they are in someway linked to blockchain technology which I suppose is no surprise, it makes sense that many people trying to take advantage of emerging technologies would also be crypo enthusiasts.

Some of these services were quite impressive in their outputs whilst others were less so, but either way I was left unsatisfied with the low image resolution and limited availability so I looked for how I could actually do this stuff on my own PC. It did not actually take long to come across Stable Diffusion and Midjourney. I expect the pros and cons of each could be debated endlessly but I will asbtain from such discussions as I have so far only tried Stable Diffusion.

At first glance the images that people post online will look incredible. If anyone can just run some words through a program and get this high quality art, what do we need artists for? Surely their jobs have been automated away right? In my opinion, no. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

### Training data limitations

What I think is important to understand is that everything that is output is based on a finite set of training data. When you want to generate some images you need to choose a checkpoint file to use. In the simplest terms a checkpoint file is simply an end result of a set of training data, and the creators probably had a particular style in mind when collating it all. Maybe it focuses on animals, photorealistic humans, RPG style art, anime, cyberpunk and so on. The larger the training data set, the more varied the outputs may be but it will likely always lack variety in some form. This tends to become evident when you generate a sufficient amount of images - you start to notice how even though many of the results look fantastic, there are definite similarities between them. For example, you may create countless pictures of a young white brunette woman in various contexts and notice that she has a pretty similar generic facial structure in all of them. In real life every person is noticeably different; different nose shapes and sizes, different eye shapes, cheek bones, jaw lines and so on. Due to the limitations of training data, there will be less variety of these things in the outputs.

### Understanding of the user's desires

AI does what I consider to be a seriously impressive job of taking in text prompts and making images that more or less conform to them. However, they will never(?) be truly accurate or as flexible as a human can be. You can feed in the most descriptive prompt in the world but not everything you describe will be in the end result. You can assign weightings to keywords to improve likelihood of them influencing the output but again, in the end you're at the mercy of randomness. I think this is part of the excitement, the AI interpretation of your prompt may even result in an amazing image that you hadn't actually thought of. Still, if you have an image in your mind that you want recreated as accurately as possible your best bet is to work with a human artist who can consult you throughout the development of the artwork and make changes based on your direction.

### Flaws in the image

It is not hard to find examples of glaring flaws in images, even if they are perfect at a glance. If you scroll back up to the first image I included on this page you can see half of his index finger is missing! From minor flaws like this, or a missing earring, or liquidy eyes to major mistakes like an arm bending the wrong way or fireplaces blending into each other through some weird extradimensional plane, there is almost always something you can point to and say "yep, this is AI made". Whilst all this may be acceptable for the average person having fun with this as a hobby, or making a super cool character portrait for their Dungeons and Dragons character, it just will not cut it for professional use cases.

## Thoughts on the future

So will AI replace artists? I don't think so. At least not for quite a while yet. The main reasons why are:

1. Training data limitations result in limited output (e.g. common facial structures on people across images)
2. Output is random, not an actual replication of what you are imagining so it may come close but will never be exact.
3. There are always flaws. An extra finger here, a disfigured eye there. A missing earring. Broken backgrounds.

AI art is only going to get better. In fact the improvements that have been made in just the last six months or year alone are phenomenal. I still don't believe it will reach a point where artists are made redundant though. It is still just machine learning after all, not true AI.
